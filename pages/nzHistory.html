                <p>New Zealand’s founding document, known as the Treaty of Waitangi, is an agreement between the British
                    Crown and the some 540 Maori rangatira (chiefs). Historically, this was a controversial document
                    because the Maori and English versions stipulated different things about land ownership rights and
                    sovereignty. In present times, the Treaty is fully honoured in legislation and court proceedings.

                <p>A series of land wars in the 19th century brought drastic changes to New Zealand society. Between the
                    1820s and 1830s, the inter-tribal Musket Wars decimated many Maori iwi (tribes) and led to a number
                    of land ownership complications. This, along with the Treaty of Waitangi, paved the way for the New
                    Zealand Wars – a collection of conflicts between European settlers and Maori who wanted to protect
                    their territories. Most of the casualties during the New Zealand Wars were Maori.</p>

                <p>On 19 September 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing country to give women the right to
                    vote in parliamentary elections. The Electoral Act was signed into law by then-governor Lord Glasgow
                    and came about after years of suffrage movements and petitions. These campaigns were led by Kate
                    Sheppard and inspired by the American-based Women’s Christian Temperance Union.</p>

                <p>It is generally agreed that the Gallipoli during the First World War fostered a sense of national
                    identity in New Zealand and Australia. One in four New Zealand men between the ages of 20 and 45 who
                    were sent to battle were either killed or wounded – this in turn affected many families and
                    communities back home. In Gallipoli, there were 2,779 New Zealand casualties, as well as 8,700
                    Australian deaths. ANZAC Day on 25 April remembers the death of these soldiers.</p>

                <p>On 3 February 1931, the Hawke’s Bay region was struck by New Zealand’s deadliest earthquake. Napier
                    and Hastings were hit the hardest by the 7.8 magnitude quake, which took the lives of at least 256
                    people – some unofficial accounts place the number at around 258. As a silver lining, the rebuild
                    efforts transformed the Hawke’s Bay into a thriving Art Deco region.</p>

                <p>New Zealand stopped being a colony in 1907, when it was officially recognised as a British Empire
                    dominion. This, however, did not make any difference to the country in terms of legal or political
                    standing – at the time, very few New Zealanders wanted full independence from Britain. While the
                    Statute of Westminster 1931 removed London’s right to legislate for British dominions without
                    explicit permission, New Zealand chose not to ratify the document until 1947.</p>

                <p>The Dawn Raids are known for being one of the darkest moments in New Zealand race relations. Between
                    1974 and 1976, the police began raiding the homes of suspected ‘overstayers’ – temporary workers
                    with expired visas. This was usually done at night or in the early hours of the morning. Samoan and
                    Tongan migrants were singled out, despite the fact that many temporary immigrants had actually come
                    from Australia and Britain.</p>

                <p>New Zealand had a well-established anti-nuclear stance by the mid 1980s. The Rainbow Warrior bombing
                    was the first act of terrorism in New Zealand territory – and, while it was targeted at Greenpeace
                    protests against nuclear testing, New Zealanders took the attack personally. This ultimately led to
                    deteriorating relations between New Zealand and France for the remainder of the 20th century. In
                    2015, the French intelligence agent involved in the attack made a public apology for his actions.

                <p>A binding referendum in 1993 led New Zealand to change its voting system from the traditional first
                    past the post (FPP) approach to the more inclusive mixed-member proportional (MMP) method. This is
                    touted as being the most dramatic change in New Zealand’s electoral history after the women’s
                    suffrage movement – allowing more political parties to emerge, thus enabling parliament to become
                    more representative of the society at large.</p>

                <p>Jenny Shipley became New Zealand’s first female Prime Minister after a successful campaign to oust
                    her predecessor, Jim Bolger. Between 1990 and 1997, she held several ministerial portfolios,
                    including Women’s Affairs, social welfare and health – these last two being the ones where she
                    caused the most controversy. Shipley left parliament in 1998, paving the way for the first elected
                    women Prime Minister, Helen Clark, to come to power in 1999.</p>

                <p>Disputes over Maori rights to the foreshore (the land that is covered by the tide) and the seabed
                    (the part of the ocean around the coast) can be traced back to early colonial times. But it was a
                    court case brought by Maori in the Marlborough Sounds in 1997 that led to the establishment of the
                    Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, which cemented the Crown’s ownership status of the land. After
                    several protests and ongoing debates, the act was repealed and replaced with the ‘no ownership’
                    regime of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011.</p>

                <p>While the September 2010 Canterbury earthquake had no casualties, it was the largest to affect an
                    urban area since the one in Hawke’s Bay – destroying many properties across the region. In 2011, the
                    Christchurch quake surpassed that – with a 6.3 magnitude and a death toll of 185, this was New
                    Zealand’s worst natural disaster in terms of human lives lost since 1931. Christchurch’s
                    reconstruction efforts are ongoing.</p>
